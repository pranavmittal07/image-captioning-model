# 🖼️ **Image Captioning using CNN + LSTM**

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements an **Image Captioning system** that generates natural language descriptions for images. It leverages the combined power of **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing** using a **CNN-RNN (LSTM) architecture**. The goal is to take an image as input and output a descriptive caption that accurately summarizes its content.

At its core:
- **CNNs** (Convolutional Neural Networks) extract meaningful features from the image.
- **LSTMs** (Long Short-Term Memory networks) generate coherent text sequences based on these image features.
